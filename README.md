# Websocket template
A template designed to get started with websockets for any projects. It is running on node js and has express js on top as a framework.
## Getting started!
`Prerequisites`
1) [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Clone the folder to your computer using your terminal or gitbash if windows.
CD into the folder and run the following command in your terminal or gitbash.
```sh
$ npm install
```

One of the packages found in `package.json` called [NODEMON](https://nodemon.io/) is only a dev-dependency.


## Running!
Run the following command.
```sh
$ nodemon index.js
```
Thats it! The server is running. The code is well documented so hopefully you can follow through. To run the Frontend just visit local host and the `port :3000` since thats what is running on index.js file.
